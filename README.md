# Functional Programming with Haskell

Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”. You'll find the FP codes I did with HASKELL in this repository.
